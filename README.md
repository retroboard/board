RetroBoard is a secure, fast, private and collaborative board for retrospectives. We take your privacy very seriously, that's why RetroBoard is secure & private by design. RetroBoard is completely peer-to-peer and decentralized. We never process personal data, we don’t store such data centrally on a server. This means we can’t pass on or sell your data to third parties.
